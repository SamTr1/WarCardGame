# WarCardGame
This project implements the classic two-player card game "War" using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The game simulates the entire gameplay experience, from dealing cards to determining the winner.

# Features
Object-Oriented Design: Utilizes OOP principles to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase, with classes for the deck, cards, players, and game logic.
Two-Player Gameplay: Simulates the traditional War card game where two players compete until one player wins all the cards.
Automated Gameplay: The game logic automatically handles dealing cards, comparing them, and awarding the round winner.
Detailed Game Flow: Includes methods for shuffling the deck, playing rounds, and checking for the game's end condition.
